## **About Me**

I am a cybersecurity professional with experience across governance, risk, compliance, security operations, and hands-on investigation workflows.  
My work includes log analysis, risk assessments, SIEM query development, incident triage, control evaluation, and translating technical findings into clear, actionable insights.

I focus on improving visibility, strengthening controls, and supporting secure decision-making across both technical and business environments.

---

## **Core Competencies**

- Conducting structured risk assessments, identifying control gaps, evaluating business impact, and aligning controls with frameworks such as NIST CSF, ISO 27001/2702, COBIT, and SOC.
- Performing end-to-end log investigations across Windows, Linux, network, email, and cloud sources to identify patterns, anomalies, and indicators of compromise.
- Building SIEM queries (KQL, SPL) to detect brute-force attempts, persistence mechanisms, lateral movement, suspicious authentication, and cloud-based anomalies.
- Triaging alerts using repeatable investigation workflows: scoping, evidence gathering, correlation, hypothesis testing, and documenting findings.
- Conducting adversary behaviour analysis using concepts from MITRE ATT&CK to differentiate noise from authentic threats and identify attacker objectives.
- Interpreting policies, security standards, and audit requirements to ensure technical evidence supports compliance and risk reduction.
- Producing structured investigation notes, reports, and executive summaries that communicate risk and security impact clearly.
- Evaluating endpoint, identity, and network telemetry to determine true positives and false positives during investigations.
- Supporting governance and engineering by validating logging coverage, reviewing control evidence, and identifying monitoring gaps.
- Automating SOC processes using Python, PowerShell, JSON, and enrichment workflows.
- Collaborating with teams to improve detections, reduce false positives, and strengthen overall security posture.
